To request your key and secret, send mail to fantasy.football@nfl.com.\\n\\n            <h3>Authentication</h3>\\n            <p>\\n            The majority of services requires the user to be logged in using an authToken. You\\'ll first make a call to the /auth/login web service which will return you back an authToken.  You\\'ll then pass that authToken to the rest of the services as a GET or POST parameter.\\n            </p><br/>\\n            <p>\\n            Most service calls are made by an application on behalf of the user. There are some service calls, however, which allow the application to change it\\'s own state. For these services, a different authToken is needed. For these calls, you\\'ll first make a call to the /application/login web service which will return you an application authToken. You will then pass that application authToken to those application services that need it (e.g. /application/editnotificationstatus).\\n            </p>\\n\\n            <h3>Example Scenario - Getting a team\\'s roster</h3>\\n            <ol>\\n                <li>Make a call to the /auth/login service to get an authToken for the user.</li>\\n                <li>Make a call to the /user/leagues to get a list of leagues the user is in.</li>\\n                <li>Make a call to the /league/team/roster for a team the user is in.</li>\\n            </ol>\\n\\n            \\n            <h3>Service Errors</h3>\\n\\n            <h3>HTTP Response Codes</h3>\\n            <p>A 200 response code will be returned for successful requests. A 400 response code for errors along with a list of the errors.  A 500 response code if there was an internal error on our side (no error message will be returned in this case.)</p>\\n\\n            <h3>Error Representaton</h3>\\n            <p>In the case of a webservice error, an error xml (defaul) or json response will be returned to the caller.  The representation can show multiple errors for the same call. Example error representation:</p>\\n            <br/><br/>\\n            XML:      \\n            <pre>\\n            \\n&lt;errors&gt;\\n  &lt;error id=&quot;authToken&quot;&gt;You have entered an invalid auth token. Must be between 1 and 40 chars.&lt;/error&gt;\\n  &lt;error id=&quot;leagueId&quot;&gt;You have entered an invalid league id.&lt;/error&gt;\\n&lt;/errors&gt;\\n            </pre>\\n            <br/><br/>\\n            JSON:\\n            <pre>\\n{\"errors\": [{\"id\":\"authToken\",\"message\":\"You have entered an invalid auth token.

These error messages are only for what is passed as parameters.
